    A little more about Aryan:
        I graduated high school at the end of 2021 with an ATAR of 93.15, being the dux in Systems engineering and Physics in my school. Upon graduating I was awarded the Australian Defence force future innovators award for my year long systems engineering project. 
        This project involved designing and prototyping a heads-up display and face mask with mobile connectivity and augmented reality capabilities. This project made it into the top 5 projects in the state as part of VCE top designs. 
        
        This cemented my passion for engineering and technology, and I decided to pursue a degree in software engineering at Monash University.

        Currently I work as a customer support officer at Cardinia Shire council, where I have honed my communication skills and ability to work in a team environment.
        My role entails a host of activities such as customer interactions, record keeping, receipting, coordination with other departments, and provision of information in a digestible format for clients. 
        This has familiarised me with countless aspects of local and state laws. Daily, I am exposed to Victorian building regulations, planning constraints and considerations (by way of planning scheme zones and overlays), local law in addition to rates and charges. 
        Soft and hard skills are complementary; this role has allowed me to demonstrably hone the former, whilst also remaining committed to cultivating technical skills in the academic setting of Monash University.
